// Provider-selectable (pg/rx_input_backup.h's `provider` field): only SBUS is
// implemented today, but the split between this generic file and one file per
// provider (e.g. rx_input_backup_sbus.c) exists so adding another protocol is
// "add one file + one dispatch case", not a rework of this file. There is
// deliberately no telemetry support on this link, ever - it exists purely to
// hand over channel data, same as a physical backup satellite receiver would.

// Keep in sync with cli/settings.c's lookupTableRxInputBackupProvider[] (same
// order) and pg/rx_input_backup.h's `provider` field width (uint8_t). Kept
// fully populated regardless of which USE_RX_INPUT_BACKUP_xxx flags a given
// target builds - same convention rx/rx.h's SerialRXType uses - only the
// dispatch switch in rx_input_backup.c's Init function is #ifdef-guarded.
