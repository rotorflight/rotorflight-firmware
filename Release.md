### Notes

1. There is a new website [www.rotorflight.org](https://www.rotorflight.org/) for Rotorflight 2.

   Big thanks to the documentation team for setting this up!

1. Please download and install [Rotorflight Configurator](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-configurator/releases/tag/release/2.0.0-RC1) before attempting to flash this firmware.

1. Rotorflight 2 is **NOT** backward compatible with RF1. You **MUST NOT** load your configuration dump from RF1 into RF2.

1. If coming from RF1, please setup your helicopter from scratch for RF2. Follow the instructions on the website!

1. As always, please double check your configuration on the bench before flying!


### Support

The main source of Rotorflight information and instructions is now the [website](https://www.rotorflight.org/).

Rotorflight has a strong presence on the Discord platform - you can join us [here](https://discord.gg/FyfMF4RwSA/).
Discord is the primary location for support, questions and discussions. The developers are all active there,
and so are the manufacturers of RF Flight Controllers. Many pro pilots are also there.
This is a great place to ask for advice or discuss any complicated problems or even new ideas.

There is also a [Rotorflight Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/876445460825093) for hanging out with other Rotorflight pilots.


### Changes

RF2 is based on Betaflight 4.3.x, and is rewritten from ground up, with the experience learned from Rotorflight-1.

Lots of things have changed in the two years of development. A full changelog can be found online later.
