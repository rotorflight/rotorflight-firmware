## Changes from 4.3.0

#### Custom CRSF/ELRS telemetry

A brand new custom telemetry has been implemented for ELRS. It allows
arbitrary number of sensors, not limited by the CRSF protocol.
Currently there are over 100 sensors to choose from, and a maximum of
40 sensors total. With the ELRS configurable telemetry ratio,
the sensors can be updated up to 20 times per second.

#### Swashplate wiggle indications

The swashplate is now indicating the FC readiness by doing a wiggle.
Also, any errors or arming failures are now clearly indicated.
Currently there are three different kind of wiggles:
- FC ready to be armed
- Arming not yet possible
- Armin permanent failure
- Armed succesfully (disabled by default)

#### SBUS2 support

SBUS2 telemetry is now available on the F7 and H7 targets.

#### Tx/Rx pinswap for serial ports

A support for swapping the Tx/Rx pins on serial receivers, ESC telemetry,
and transmitter telemetry UARTs have been added.

#### ESC Forward Programming support

A support for ESC Forward Programming has been added. So far,
three ESC vendors/models are supported:
- Hobbywing Platinum V5
- Scorpion
- YGE (beta firmware required)

#### BB logging for ESC telemetry

Three new BB log options have been added: ESC, BEC and ESC2.
These options are logging the data received from the ESC(s).

#### Other Changes

- Adjustments for acc trims
- Improvements in BB headers
- Improvements in Cyclic Cross-Coupling
- Fix adjfunction initilisation bug
- Better battery voltage filtering
- model_id parameter
- Various CMS fixes

## Notes

1. There is a new website [www.rotorflight.org](https://www.rotorflight.org/) for Rotorflight-2.
   The old Wiki in github is deprecated, and is for Rotorflight-1 only.
   Big thanks to the documentation team for setting this up!

2. Please download and install [Rotorflight Configurator](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-configurator/releases/) before attempting to flash this firmware.

3. Rotorflight-2 is **NOT** backward compatible with RF1. You **MUST NOT** load your configuration dump from RF1 into RF2.

4. If coming from RF1, please setup your helicopter from scratch for RF2. Follow the instructions on the website!

5. As always, please double check your configuration on the bench before flying!


## Support

The main source of Rotorflight information and instructions is now the [website](https://www.rotorflight.org/).

Rotorflight has a strong presence on the Discord platform - you can join us [here](https://discord.gg/FyfMF4RwSA/).
Discord is the primary location for support, questions and discussions. The developers are all active there,
and so are the manufacturers of RF Flight Controllers. Many pro pilots are also there.
This is a great place to ask for advice or discuss any complicated problems or even new ideas.

There is also a [Rotorflight Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/rotorflight) for hanging out with other Rotorflight pilots.


## Changes

RF2 is based on Betaflight 4.3.x, and is rewritten from ground up, with the experience learned from Rotorflight-1.

Lots of things have changed in the two years of development. A full changelog can be found in
[git](https://github.com/rotorflight/rotorflight-firmware/commits/RF-4.3.x/).
