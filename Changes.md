# Changes in Rotorflight Firmware

This file is collecting the changes in the firmware that are affecting
the APIs or flight performance.


## Flight Performance


## MSP Changes


## CLI Changes

`pid_process_denom` is a divider for the PID loop speed vs. the gyro
output data rate (ODR). With #291 the output rate is halved, dropping
the PID loop rate to half too.


## Defaults


## Features

### Drop gyro ODR to 4k on F4 and F7 (#291)

The gyro output data rate is changed from 8k to 4k on F4 and F7.
This lowers the real-time load considerably, and gives more headroom for
other functions. It should not affect performance.
