# Changes in Rotorflight Firmware

This file is collecting the changes in the firmware that are affecting
the APIs or flight performance.


## Flight Performance

The decimator is changed to use a Bessel filter (#287). It should give more
consistent D-term reaction on transients.


## MSP Changes

### MSP_PID_PROFILE

- `error_rotation` parameter is unused (#294)

### MSP_SET_PID_PROFILE

- `error_rotation` parameter is unused (#294)

### MSP_PILOT_CONFIG

- added `modelFlags` parameter (#317)

### MSP_FLIGHT_STATS

- added `MSP_FLIGHT_STATS` and `MSP_SET_FLIGHT_STATS` (#317)

## CLI Changes

`pid_process_denom` is a divider for the PID loop speed vs. the gyro
output data rate (ODR). With #291 the output rate is halved, dropping
the PID loop rate to half too.

`error_rotation` parameter is removed in #294.

`model_set_name` parameter added (ON/OFF). Corresponds with bit 0 of `pilotConfig_t.modelFlags` and is used to indicate whether the Lua scripts should set the name of the model on the radio.

`model_tell_capacity` parameter added (ON/OFF). Corresponds with bit 1 of `pilotConfig_t.modelFlags` and is used to indicate whether the Lua scripts should announce the remaining capacity of the battery.


## Defaults


## Features

### Drop gyro ODR to 4k on F4 and F7 (#291)

The gyro output data rate is changed from 8k to 4k on F4 and F7.
This lowers the real-time load considerably, and gives more headroom for
other functions. It should not affect performance.

### Use Bessel filter in the decimator (#287)

Using a Bessel filter in decimator should give better phase response
near the cutoff frequency. This should give more consistent D-term
reaction to fast movements.
